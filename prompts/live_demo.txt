The following link was provided as a submission to a hackathon:

"{{url}}" 

Go to the page and test this app, then clasify the page as a "demo link", a
"video link", or "not working". Editor environments (ie. replit, trinket,
codespaces) should be classified as "not working". Package pages (ie. pypi,
npmjs, cargo) should be classified as "demo link". Generally custom sites should
count as a "demo link" even if some functionality on the site doesn't work.

Links without a domain (ie. 102.168.19.4/index.html) should be classified as "not working".

A presentation, google doc, or google sheet is "not working".

A link to a discord invite (as long as the invite isn't expired), or a link to a
slack channel is fine to show off bots.

No yapping â€“ just respond back with the classification word and a short explanation. for example "demo link: this is a simple tic tac toe app on the web", or "not working: the page 404s"
Do not structure your output as json or another format, only use one of the
following:
