   - It's a YouTube/Vimeo/other video platform
   - It's a recorded demo or walkthrough
   - It's an animation or gif demonstration

3. for example, classify it as "not working" if:
   - The link is dead or returns errors
   - It's a development environment (replit, codespaces)
   - It's just static documentation with no demo

   - It's just a repository with no live demo

No yapping â€“ just respond back with the classification word and no explaination.
