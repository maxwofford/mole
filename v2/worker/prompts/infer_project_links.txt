Infer the following projects links if left blank:

Demo link: this cannot be the repo link (ie. https://maxwofford.com)
Repo link: this is a repo link on a public git host (ie. https://github.com/maxwofford/maxwofford.github.io)
Readme link: The link to the raw markdown for a project (ie. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxwofford/maxwofford.github.io/refs/heads/master/README.md)

Return back in this format. You can leave a field blank if you can't find a link for it. Include no other description or explainationâ€“ no yapping.
