# Mole!

_A scrappy little guy that digs around for juicy projects. Can't see very well, but he tries his best._

This project is built to help me review all the projects submitted for [High Seas](https://highseas.hackclub.com). There are 7.5k projects and only 1 of me & I want to hand review all the projects before approving them as "YSWS-worthy" projects.

Now I'm writing it as a tool for other YSWS programs to use in review. This system is built with a single-threaded scheduler (mole-nexus) that can spin up multiple workers (mole-worker).
