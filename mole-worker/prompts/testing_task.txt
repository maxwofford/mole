Visit {{url}} and create a simple testing task to verify this is a real working application.

For static/portfolio sites: Test basic functionality like navigation, links, or content display
For web apps: Test core functionality like forms, buttons, or user interactions  
For mobile apps: Return NO_TASK (cannot test mobile apps in browser)
For CLI tools: Return NO_TASK (cannot test command-line tools in browser)
For sites requiring special interactions (right-click, drag-drop, etc): Return NO_TASK

If a site has login functionality, make sure to include signup/signin as a task.
If the site has saved data, test it to make sure the data persists (ie. after signup, try logging in. on a todo app, refresh after creating a todo)

Respond with one of:
- `NO_TASK: reason` - Unable to create meaningful testing task
- 'TASK: description` - A brief, actionable testing instruction that can be performed in a browser

No yapping.
